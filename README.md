# hyprland-dotfiles

This is the Hyprland section of the ML4W dotfiles (https://gitlab.com/stephan-raabe/dotfiles), featuring my personal modifications. The only thing that may be of interest is that I have added a keybinding (SUPER + O) that triggers a bash script to toggle opacity on and off. This script is located at ~/dotfiles/hypr/scripts/toggle_opacity.sh.

An unfocussed window's content can be less easy to read, and it's useful when watching a video, but need focus on a different window simultaneously.

I created this with the assistance of ChatGPT, so please verify its functionality. While it works well for me, I am not a coder, so use it at your own risk.
